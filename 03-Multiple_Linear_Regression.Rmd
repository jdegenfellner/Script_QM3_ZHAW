# Multiple Linear Regression

So far, we have dealt with the simple mean model and the model with one predictor
in the Bayesian and Frequentist framework.
We will now add another predictor and subsequently an interaction term to the model.
Finally, we will add more than two predictors to the model.

If you feel confused at any point: As Richard McElreath repeatedly says:
This is normal, it means you are paying attention. I also refer to the
great [Richard Feynman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lytxafTXg6c&ab_channel=sdfhsfh).

## Linear Regression with 2 predictors in the Bayesian Framework

### Meaning of "linear"
What is a linear model? The term "linear" refers to the relationship of the predictors 
with the dependent variable (or outcome). The following model is also linear:

$$height_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \beta_2 x_i^2$$

The model is linear in the parameters $\beta_0, \beta_1, \beta_2$ but not in the predictors $x_i$.
The term $x_i^2$ is ok, since the heights are just sums of multiples of the predictors (which can be nonlinear).
This model is not a linear model anymore:

$$height_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + e^{\beta_2 x_i^2}$$

$\beta_2$ is now is the exponent of $e$. It would also not be linear,
if the coefficients are in a square root or in the denominator of a fraction,
or in a sine or in a logarithm. You get the idea.

Here is an easy way to check if the model is linear: If I change the predictor-value 
(i.e.,the value of $x_i$, $x_i^2$ or whatever your predictor is) by one unit,
the change in the (expected value of the) dependent variable is the coefficient in front of 
the predictor ($\beta_i$).

### Adding a transformed predictor to the model {#adding_transformed_predictor_bayes}

Around 4.5. in the book [Statistical Rethinking](https://civil.colorado.edu/~balajir/CVEN6833/bayes-resources/RM-StatRethink-Bayes.pdf)
there is are lineare regression using a quadratic term for weight. 
It is a principle, called the "**variable inclusion principle**", that we always include the lower order terms when fitting a model
with higher order terms. See [Westfall](https://vdoc.pub/documents/understanding-regression-analysis-a-conditional-distribution-approach-84oqjr8sqva0), 
p. 213. If we do not include the lower order terms, the coefficient does not measure what
we want it to meausure (curvature in our case). For instance, if we want to model a quadratic relationship (parabola) between
weight and height, we also have to include the linear term for weight ($x_i$).
Since we do not assume the relationship between weight and height to be linear but
quadratic (which is a polynomial of degree 2), we call this a 
[polynomial regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_regression#:~:text=In%20statistics%2C%20polynomial%20regression%20is,nth%20degree%20polynomial%20in%20x.).
This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QptI-vDle8Y&ab_channel=MikeXCohen) could be instructive. 
One has to be careful with fitting polynomials to data points since the regression coefficients
can become quite large. Using a polynomial of high degree implies to have a lot of parameters 
to estimate. Increasing the degree of the polynomial increases $R^2$ but also the risk of 
[overfitting](https://www.mathworks.com/discovery/overfitting.html).
(see Statistical Rethinking p. 200). So this is - of course - not the final solution to regression problems.

This time, lets look at the whole age range of data from the !Kung San people
including people with age $\le 18$ years.

```{r}
library(rethinking)
library(tidyverse)
data(Howell1)
d <- Howell1
d %>% ggplot(aes(x = weight, y = height)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "blue") +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE, color = "red")
```

It would not be a good idea to fit a linear trend through this data,
because we would not caupture the relationship adequately. 
The red line is a [loess smothing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_regression) line
which is often used to capture non-linear relationships.
The blue line is the usual line from classic linear regression (from the previous chapter).
Which one describes the data more accurately? 
In this case it is obvious, a non-linear relationship is present and it might be a good idea 
to model it. Modeling the relationship with a linear trend leads to bad residuals with structure.
We will demonstrate this in the Frequentist setting.
Unfortunately, in more complex settings, with more predictors, it is not always so easy to see.

This time, we use the mean for the prior from the book ($178 cm$).
The model equations are (see [exercise 2](#exercise2_multiple_regression)):

\begin{eqnarray*}
h_i &\sim& \text{Normal}(\mu_i, \sigma) \\
\mu_i &=& \alpha + \beta_1 x_i + \beta_2 x_i^2 \\
\alpha &\sim& \text{Normal}(178, 20) \\
\beta_1 &\sim& \text{Log-Normal}(0, 1) \\
\beta_2 &\sim& \text{Normal}(0, 1) \\
\sigma &\sim& \text{Uniform}(0, 50)
\end{eqnarray*}

The prior for $\beta_1$ is log-normal, because we can reasonably assume
the the overall linear trend is positive. 
The prior for $\beta_2$ is normal, because
we are not so sure about the sign yet. If we thought back to our school days to the topic of 
"curve discussion" or parabolas, we could probably also assume that $\beta_2$ is negative.
But, data will show.

How can we interpret the model equations? 
The model assumes that the **expected** height $\mu_i$ of a person $i$
depends non-linearly (quadratically) on the (standardized) weight $x_i$ of the person.
We are in the business of mean-modeling. 
The prior for $\sigma$ is uniform as before.
The prior for $\alpha$ is normal with mean $178$ and standard deviation $20$
because this is what we can expect from body heights in our experience.

Let's **fit the model**:

We standardize the weight again and add the squared weights to the data set.
Standardizing the predictors is a good idea, especially in polynomial regression
since squares and cubes of large numbers can get huge and cause numerical problems.

Let's fit the model with the quadratic term for weight:

```{r}
# Standardize weight
d$weight_s <- (d$weight - mean(d$weight)) / sd(d$weight)
# Square of standardized weight
d$weight_s2 <- d$weight_s^2
m4.1 <- quap(
  alist(
    height ~ dnorm(mu, sigma),
    mu <- a + b1*weight_s + b2*weight_s^2,
    a ~ dnorm(178, 20),
    b1 ~ dnorm(0, 10),
    b2 ~ dnorm(0, 10),
    sigma ~ dunif(0, 50)
  ), data = d)
precis(m4.1)
plot(precis(m4.1, pars = c("b1", "b2", "sigma")))
```

$\beta_2$ is indeed negative. 
In the estimate-plot above I have left out the intercept $\alpha$ to 
make the other coefficients more visible. As you can see, the credible intervals
are very tight. Using prior knowledge and data, the model is very sure about the 
coefficients.
We get our **[joint distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_probability_distribution)** 
of the **four model parameters**.
Let's look at the fit using the mean estimates of the posterior distribution:

```{r}
# Summarize the model parameters
model_summary <- precis(m4.1)
params <- as.data.frame(model_summary)

# Extract parameter values
a <- params["a", "mean"]       # Intercept
b1 <- params["b1", "mean"]     # Coefficient for standardized weight
b2 <- params["b2", "mean"]     # Coefficient for squared standardized weight

# Generate a sequence of standardized weights for the fitted curve
weight_seq <- seq(min(d$weight_s), max(d$weight_s), length.out = 200)

# Calculate the fitted values using the quadratic equation
height_fitted <- a + b1 * weight_seq + b2 * weight_seq^2

# Plot the scatterplot
plot(d$weight_s, d$height, pch = 16, col = "blue",
     xlab = "Standardized Weight", ylab = "Height (cm)",
     main = "Scatterplot with Fitted Curve (Standardized Weight)")

# Add the fitted curve
lines(weight_seq, height_fitted, col = "red", lwd = 2)

# Add a legend
legend("topright", legend = c("Observed data", "Fitted curve"),
       col = c("blue", "red"), pch = c(16, NA), lty = c(NA, 1), lwd = 2)

       # ======== Simulate Heights from Posterior ========

# Prepare new data with the same number of rows as the original data
new_data <- data.frame(weight_s = d$weight_s, weight_s2 = d$weight_s2)

# Simulate height values from the posterior (same number as original data)
sim_heights <- sim(m4.1, data = new_data, n = nrow(d))  # Posterior samples

# Extract random samples from simulated heights
height_samples <- apply(sim_heights, 2, function(x) sample(x, 1))

# ======== Plot Observed vs. Simulated Heights ========

# Plot observed data
plot(d$weight_s, d$height, pch = 16, col = "blue",
     xlab = "Standardized Weight", ylab = "Height (cm)",
     main = "Observed vs. Simulated Heights")

# Add simulated height points
points(d$weight_s, height_samples, pch = 16, col = "red")

# Add legend
legend("topright", legend = c("Observed Data", "Simulated Data"),
       col = c("blue", "red"), pch = c(16, 16))

```

The second plot shows the original heights and simulated heights from the 
posterior distribution in one plot. This fits quite well.

The quadratic model fits much better than the linear model without the quadratic term. 
In the book, there is also a polynomial regression with a cubic term for weight.
Maybe this fits even better (see [exercise 1](#exercise1_multiple_regression)).

The quadratic model has a very high $R^2$ value. In this case,
this is a good sign. The height values "wiggle" around the fitted curve
very narrowly. We do not need other variables to explain the heights.
In short: If you know a person's weight, you can predict the height very well
(in this population at least). One might hypothesize that the population
behaves rather similarly with respect to nutritional and life style factors.
If different groups within the !Kung San people would have high calorie intake
and few physical activity, the model would probably not fit so well.

### Adding another predictor to the model {#adding_predictor_bayes}

Since the !Kung San data set has already such a high $R^2$ ($=0.95$!) with the quadratic term 
(and possibly higher with the cubic term), we will use the created data set from 
[below](#adding_predictor_freq) in the frequentist setting
to estimate the coefficients of the model with two predictors here as well.
We *have* the true but (usually) unknown data generating 
mechnisms (for didactic reasons).

We use rather uniformative priors and fit the model using `quap`:


```{r}
library(rethinking)
set.seed(123)
n <- 100
X1 <- rnorm(n, 0, 5)
X2 <- rnorm(n, 0, 5)
Y <- 10 + 0.5 * X1 + 1 * X2 + rnorm(n, 0, 2) # true model
df <- data.frame(X1 = X1, X2 = X2, Y = Y)

# fit model
m4.2 <- quap(
  alist(
    Y ~ dnorm(mu, sigma),
    mu <- a + b1*X1 + b2*X2,
    a ~ dnorm(10, 10),
    b1 ~ dnorm(0, 10),
    b2 ~ dnorm(0, 10),
    sigma ~ dunif(0, 50)
  ), data = df)
precis(m4.2)
```


#### Checking model assumptions {#check_model_bayes}
Andrew Gelman mentions in some of his talks (see [here](https://sites.stat.columbia.edu/gelman/research/published/philosophy_chapter.pdf) for more details) 
that many Bayesians he met do not check their models, since they reflect subjective probability.
As I said in the introduction, one should not be afraid to check model predictions against the observed
and probably new data. If a model for predicting BMI performs much worse on a new data set,
we should adapt. We **do not ask** the question if a model is true or false, but if it is useful or
how badly the model assumptions are violated.

For further, more detailed information on model checking, refer to chapter 6 of 
[Gelman's book](https://sites.stat.columbia.edu/gelman/book/BDA3.pdf).

Anyhow, we plot two posterior predictive checks here.
We test the model within the same data set. 
In order to do this, we create new observations
by drawing from the posterior distribution and compare these with the acutally 
observed values. This is called **posterior predictive checks**.

**First, we plot the observed $Y$ values against the predicted $Y$ values ($=\hat{Y}$)** 
from the model (as in Statistical rethinking, Chapter 5).
Although these practically never lie on the line $y=x$, they should be sufficiently 
close to it. We could also compare these two plots with the mean-model (see [exercise 6](#exercise6_multiple_regression)).

```{r}
# 1) Posterior predictive checks Y vs Y_hat
# see Statstical Rethinking p 138.
# call link without specifying new data
# so it uses the original data
mu <- link(m4.2)

# summarize samples accross cases
mu_mean <- apply(mu, 2, mean)
mu_PI <- apply(mu, 2, PI, prob = 0.89)

# simulate observations
# again, no new data, so uses original data
D_sim <- sim(m4.2, n = 1e4)
D_PI <- apply(D_sim, 2, PI, prob = 0.89)

plot(mu_mean ~ df$Y, col = rangi2, ylim = range(mu_PI), 
     xlab = "Observed Y", ylab = "Model-Predicted Y")
abline(a = 0, b = 1, lty = 2)
for(i in 1:nrow(df)) lines(rep(df$Y[i], 2), mu_PI[,i], col = rangi2)
```

As we can see, the model fits the data quite well. The points are close to the dashed line ($y=x$).
No under- or overestimation is visible. The model seems to capture the relationship between the predictors $X_1$ and $X_2$
and the dependent variable $Y$ quite well - at least in a predictive sense. If there were patches of data points above or below the dashed line,
we would probably have to reconsider the model definition and think about why these points are not captured by the model.

**Next, we plot the posterior predictive plots** analog to the upper left in the `check_model` output.

```{r}
library(scales)  # For the alpha function to adjust transparency

# 2) Posterior predictive densities
# Simulate observations using the posterior predictive distribution
D_sim <- sim(m4.2, n = 1e4)  # Generate 10,000 simulated datasets

# Calculate densities for all samples
densities <- apply(D_sim, 1, density)

# Find the maximum density value for setting the y-axis limits
max_density <- max(sapply(densities, function(d) max(d$y)))

# Create the density plot with predefined ylim
plot(NULL, xlim = range(df$Y), ylim = c(0, max_density),
     xlab = "Y", ylab = "Density",
     main = "Comparison of Observed and Predicted Densities")

# Add 100 posterior predictive density lines
set.seed(42)  # For reproducibility
n_lines <- 100
samples <- sample(1:1e4, n_lines)  # Randomly sample 100 posterior predictive datasets
for (s in samples) {
  lines(density(D_sim[s, ]), col = alpha("lightblue", 0.3), lwd = 1)
}

# Add the density line for the observed Y values
obs_density <- density(df$Y)
lines(obs_density$x, obs_density$y, col = "green", lwd = 2)

# Add legend
legend("topright", legend = c("Posterior Predictive Densities", "Observed Density"),
       col = c("lightblue", "green"), lty = 1, lwd = c(1, 2))
```

The light blue lines show distributions of model predicted $Y$ values. 
The green line shows the distribution of the observed $Y$ values.
As we can see, there seem to be no systematic differences between the observed and predicted values. 
The model seems to capture the relationship well.
If we see systematic deviations here, we need to reconsider the model definition. 

**Example**: If you want to predict pain ($Y$ variable) and you have a lot of zeros (pain-free participants)
you will probably see a discrepancy between the observed and predicted values in this plot.
What could you do? You could use a two step process (model the probability that a person is pain-free 
and then model the pain intensity for the people who have pain) or use a different model (like a zero-inflated model).

Note that we did not explicitely assume normally distributed errors in the model definition above,
so we won't check this here but in the Frequentist framework below.

## Linear regression with 2 predictors in the Frequentist Framework 

To reiterate from the last chapter:
In full, the **classical linear regression model** can be written as 
(see p. 21-22 in Westfall):

$$ Y_i|X_i = x_i \sim_{independent} N(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i1} + \dots \beta_k x_{ik},\sigma^2)$$
for $i = 1, \dots, n$.

The $Y_i$ are independently normally distributed *conditioned* on the predictors 
having the values $X_i = x_i$. Each conditional distribution has an expected value ($\mu$)
that is a linear function of the predictors and a constant variance $\sigma^2$.

If the assumptions of the classical linear regression model are met, the least squares
estimators (OLS) are the best (smallest variance) linear unbiased (on average correct) estimators 
- so-called: **BLUE** - of the parameters.

### Adding a transformed predictor to the model {#adding_transformed_predictor_freq}

No, let's fit the same model as [above](#adding_transformed_predictor_bayes) in the Bayesian framework.

The model is:

$$height_i = \alpha + \beta_1 weight_i + \beta_2 weight_i^2 + \varepsilon_i$$
whereas
$$\varepsilon_i \sim N(0, \sigma)$$

And if you build the expectation on both sides for fixed $weight_i$, you get:

$$\mathbb{E}(height_i|weight_i) = \alpha + \beta_1 weight_i + \beta_2 weight_i^2$$

The last line means, the expected height of a person given a certain weight depends 
quadratically on the weight. The error term $\varepsilon_i$ is on average zero, hence it goes away here.
Remember the [law of large numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers#Weak_law): 
The sample mean $\bar{\varepsilon_i}$ approaches the expected value $\mathbb{E}(\varepsilon_i)=0$ 
as the sample size increases. If you drew many samples (from the true model) 
and average over the error terms, the average will approach zero. 
Think of [this](https://github.com/jdegenfellner/ZHAW_Teaching/blob/main/Wiggle_in_simple_linear_regression.R) animated 
graph if you need a dynamic image of the regression model.
The weights are considered fixed and therefore do not change when building the expectation.

We are looking for fixed, but unknown, parameters $\alpha$, $\beta_1$, $\beta_2$ and $\sigma$.
The fixed $\sigma$ indicates that the observations *wiggle* around the expected value
equally strong not matter which weight we have. This is called **homoscedasticity**.

Let's fit the model using the `lm` function in R which uses 
[least squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_squares) to estimate the parameters.
At this point I could torture you with [matrix algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics)) 
and show you the [normal equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_least_squares) for linear regression,
but I will spare you for now.
Note that the least squares algorithm for fitting the curve works for all
kinds of functional forms. For example, we could also fit an exponential curve using the same
technique (see [exercise 9](#exercise9_multiple_regression)).

```{r}
# scale weight
d$weight_s <- scale(d$weight)
# Fit the model
m4.2 <- lm(height ~ weight_s + I(weight_s^2), data = d)
summary(m4.2)
mean(d$height)
confint(m4.2, level = 0.94)
```

See `?I` in R. This command is used so that R knows that it should 
treat the "^2" as "square" and not as formula syntax.
We could also create a new variable as before. Whatever you prefer.

#### Interpretation of output and coefficients {#interpretation_output_freq_quadratic}

- The intercept $\alpha$ is the **model-predicted height** of a person of **average weight** 
  ($weight_s=0$ for a person of average weight).
  Note that this is not equal to the average height ($138.2636~cm$) of the people in the data set 
  (see [exercise 12](#exercise12_multiple_regression)).
- The residuals have range from $-19.97$ to $19.51$. So, the model maximally
  overestimates the heights by $19.97$ cm and underestimates by $19.51$ cm.
  These numbers are plausible when you look at the scatterplot with the fitted
  curve.
- The coefficients $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ agree with the Bayes estimates.
  Specifically, $\beta_2$ is non-zero indicating curvature. You cannot directly interpret the coefficients
  as in the non-quadratic case since, for instance, you cannot change $weight^2$ by one unit
  and hold $weight$ constant at the same time. Refer to Peter Westfall's book section 9.1. for all the details.
- If you like $p$-values: All the hypotheses that the coefficients are zero
  are rejected. The $p$-values are very small. The values of the test statistics can not be explained
  by chance alone. On the other hand, for at least $\beta_1$ and
  and the global test this is not a surprise when you look at the scatterplot.
  After having fit many models, you would have guessed that all three parameters 
  are solidly non-zero. The intercept is not zero since a person of average weight probably
  has non-zero height. $\beta_1$ is non-zero since you can easily imagine a linear
  trend line with positive slope going through the data, and $\beta_2$ is non-zero
  since there is clearly (non-trivial) curvature in the scatterplot.
- The $R^2$ is a whopping $0.96$ which could be a sign of overfitting, but
  in this case we conclude that the true relationship is caputured rather well.
  [Overfitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting) would occur if 
  our curve would rather fit the noise in the data than
  the underying trend.

#### Checking model assumptions

```{r, warnings=FALSE}
library(performance)
check_model(m4.2)
```

If we want to be perfectionists, we could remark that (upper right plot)
in the lower fitted values the residuals are more negative, 
meaning that the model overestimates the heights in this region.
In the middle region the model underestimates a bit and we can see
a positive tendency in the residuals. Apart from that,
the diagnostic plots look excellent.

### Adding another predictor to the model {#adding_predictor_freq}

Now, we add another predictor to the model. We use $X_1$ and $X_2$ 
**simultaneously** to predict $Y$. We are now in the lucky situation that
we can still visualize the situation in 3D. The regression line from simple
linear regression
becomes a [plane](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47344850/scatterplot3d-regression-plane-with-residuals).
The vertical distances between the data points and the plane are the residuals.
See [here](https://rpubs.com/pjozefek/576206) or 
[here](https://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/scatterplot3d-3d-graphics-r-software-and-data-visualization)
at the end for examples.
Minimizing the sum of the squared errors gives again 
the estimates for the coefficients. 

For demonstration purposes, we can **create data ourselves** with known
coefficients. This is the same as [above](#adding_predictor_bayes).
This is the true model, which we usually do not know:

$$ Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{1i} + \beta_2 X_{2i} + \varepsilon_i$$
$$ \varepsilon_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$$
$$ \mathbb{E}(Y_i|X_1 = x_1; X_2 = x_2) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2$$
$$ i = 1 \ldots n$$

for example:

$$ Y_i = 10 + 0.5 \cdot X_{1i} + 1 \cdot X_{2i} + \varepsilon_i$$
$$ \varepsilon_i \sim N(0, 5)$$
$$ \mathbb{E}(Y_i|X_1 = x_1; X_2 = x_2) = 10 + 0.5 x_1 + 1 x_2$$
$$ i = 1 \ldots n$$


According to the model, the conditional expected value of $Y_i$ given $X_1 = x_1$ and $X_2 = x_2$
is a linear function of $x_1$ and $x_2$. Note, that small letters are realized values
of random variables. Also note, that in the expectation the error term goes away, since
$\mathbb{E}(\varepsilon_i) = 0$.

- If $X_1$ increases by one unit, $Y$ increases by $0.5$ units on average (in expectation).
- If $X_2$ increases by one unit, $Y$ increases by $1$ unit on average (in expectation).
- If $X_1$ and $X_2$ are zero, $Y$ is $10$ on average (in expectation).

Why in expectation? Because there is still the error term which makes the whole thing random!
We can see that an increase in $X_1$ does not influence the relationship between $X_2$ and $Y$.
Hence, there is **no interaction** between $X_1$ and $X_2$ with respect to $Y$.

Now lets's draw 100 points from this model, fit the model and add the plane:

```{r}
library(plotly)

set.seed(123)
n <- 100
X1 <- rnorm(n, 0, 5)
X2 <- rnorm(n, 0, 5)
Y <- 10 + 0.5 * X1 + 1 * X2 + rnorm(n, 0, 2)
d <- data.frame(X1 = X1, X2 = X2, Y = Y)

# Fit the model
m4.3 <- lm(Y ~ X1 + X2, data = d)
summary(m4.3)

# Create a grid for the plane
X1_grid <- seq(min(d$X1), max(d$X1), length.out = 20)
X2_grid <- seq(min(d$X2), max(d$X2), length.out = 20)
grid <- expand.grid(X1 = X1_grid, X2 = X2_grid)

# Predict the values for the grid
grid$Y <- predict(m4.3, newdata = grid)

# Convert the grid into a matrix for the plane
plane_matrix <- matrix(grid$Y, nrow = length(X1_grid), ncol = length(X2_grid))

# Create the interactive 3D plot
plot_ly() %>%
  add_markers(
    x = d$X2, y = d$X1, z = d$Y,
    marker = list(color = "blue", size = 5),
    name = "Data Points"
  ) %>%
  add_surface(
    x = X1_grid, y = X2_grid, z = plane_matrix,
    colorscale = list(c(0, 1), c("red", "pink")),
    showscale = FALSE,
    opacity = 0.7,
    name = "Fitted Plane"
  ) %>%
  plotly::layout(
    scene = list(
      xaxis = list(title = "X1"),
      yaxis = list(title = "X2"),
      zaxis = list(title = "Y")
    ),
    title = "Interactive 3D Scatterplot with Fitted Plane"
  )
```

This is, of course, a very idealized situation. There is no curvature in the plane,
no interaction, no outliers, no heteroscadasticity. It's the simplest case of multiple regression
with 2 predictors. Reality is - usually - more complicated.

Let's look at the summary output and check model assumptions:

```{r}
summary(m4.3)
check_model(m4.3)
```

We could repeat this simulation to get a feeling for the variability.
The posterior predictive checks look nice. In this case, we *know* that the model is true.

#### Adding variables to the model and why

This is a very complex question. We will go into it in later chapters and the next course (Methodenvertiefung).
At this point we can say this:
We add variables to the model (and probably use 
other models apart from linear regression) *depending* on the goal at hand (prediction or explanation).

- **Prediction** (i.e. guessing the outcome as good as possible) seems to be easier 
  than explanation. For instance, within linear models and 
  just a handful of predictors, one can even brute force the problem by searching through
  all subsets of predictors. If that is not possible, one could use clever algortithms, like 
  [best subest selection](https://www.sthda.com/english/articles/37-model-selection-essentials-in-r/155-best-subsets-regression-essentials-in-r/). 

- **Explanation** (looking for causal relationships between variables) is more difficult.
  - What is **not** a good idea if you want to find *causal* relationships,
  is to throw all variables into the model and hope for the best.
  - What is also not a good idea is to select variables depending on the $p$-values of the coefficients (Westfall Chapter 11).
  - **Leaving variables out**, that are important, can lead to biased estimates of the coefficients 
  ([omitted variable bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omitted-variable_bias)).
  - Importantly, also **adding variables** can hurt conclusions from the model (see Statistical Rethinking 6.2).

### Interaction Term $X_1 \times X_2$ {#interaction_term}

I recommend reading the excellent explanations about interactions
in John Kruschke's book [Doing Bayesian Data Analysis](https://nyu-cdsc.github.io/learningr/assets/kruschke_bayesian_in_R.pdf),
15.2.2 und 15.2.3. Peter Westfall also has a nice explanation in his [book](https://www.routledge.com/Understanding-Regression-Analysis-A-Conditional-Distribution-Approach/Westfall-Arias/p/book/9780367493516?srsltid=AfmBOore3O_Ciecl0TTkr9AjPIY1d6OmbQa7o7IAdKpTSkD8s9HkwzD4) 
in section 9.3.

Our statistical model is now:

$$ Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{1i} + \beta_2 X_{2i} + \mathbf{\beta_3 X_{1i} \times X_{2i}} + \varepsilon_i$$
$$ \varepsilon_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$$
$$ \mathbb{E}(Y_i|X_1 = x_1; X_2 = x_2) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1} + \beta_2 x_{2} + \beta_3 x_{1} \times x_{2}$$
$$ i = 1 \ldots n$$

for example:

$$ Y_i = 10 + 0.5 \cdot X_{1i} + 1 \cdot X_{2i} + 0.89 \cdot X_{1i} \times X_{2i} + \varepsilon_i$$
$$ \varepsilon_i \sim N(0, 5)$$
$$ \mathbb{E}(Y_i|X_1 = x_1; X_2 = x_2) = 10 + 0.5 x_1 + 1 x_2 + 0.89 x_1 \times x_2$$
$$ i = 1 \ldots n$$

The second equation states that the conditional expectation of $Y_i$ given $X_1=x_1$ and $X_2=x_2$ 
is a function of $x_1$ and $x_2$ and their interaction $x_1 \times x_2$ (i.e., the product). 

We are in a different situation now.
Set for instance $x_2$ to a certain value, say $x_2 = 7$. Then the relationship (in expectation) 
between $Y$ and $X_1$ is:

$$ \mathbb{E}(Y_i|X_1 = x_1; X_2 = 7) = 10 + 0.5 x_1 + 1 \cdot 7 + 0.89 x_1 \cdot 7$$
$$ \mathbb{E}(Y_i|X_1 = x_1; X_2 = 7) = 10 + (0.5 + 0.89 \cdot \mathbf{7}) \cdot x_1 + 1 \cdot 7$$

Depending on the value of $x_2$, the *effect* of $X_1$ on $Y$ changes. 
Hence, $X_2$ **modifies** the relationship between $X_1$ and $Y$, or stated otherwise,
$X_1$ and $X_2$ **interact** with respect to $Y$. Remember, the word *effect* is 
used in a strictly technical/statistical sense and **not in a causal** sense.
It does not mean that if we *do* change $X_1$ by one unit, 
$Y$ will also change in an experiment. We are purely describing the relationship
in an associative way. We will probably touch causality later.
Bayesian statistics and causal inference are gaining popularity. Hence, we should try to keep up.

Let's draw 100 points from this model, fit the model and add the plane (see also [exercise 4](#exercise3_multiple_regression)):

```{r}
set.seed(123)
n <- 100
X1 <- rnorm(n, 0, 5)
X2 <- rnorm(n, 0, 5)
Y <- 10 + 0.5 * X1 + 1 * X2 + 0.89 * X1 * X2 + rnorm(n, 0, 5)
d <- data.frame(X1 = X1, X2 = X2, Y = Y)

# Fit the model
m4.4 <- lm(Y ~ X1 * X2, data = d)
summary(m4.4)

# Create a grid for the plane
X1_grid <- seq(min(d$X1), max(d$X1), length.out = 20)
X2_grid <- seq(min(d$X2), max(d$X2), length.out = 20)
grid <- expand.grid(X1 = X1_grid, X2 = X2_grid)

# Predict the values for the grid
grid$Y <- predict(m4.4, newdata = grid)

# Convert the grid into a matrix for the plane
plane_matrix <- matrix(grid$Y, nrow = length(X1_grid), ncol = length(X2_grid))

# Create the interactive 3D plot
plot_ly() %>%
  add_markers(
    x = d$X2, y = d$X1, z = d$Y,
    marker = list(color = "blue", size = 5),
    name = "Data Points"
  ) %>%
  add_surface(
    x = X1_grid, y = X2_grid, z = plane_matrix,
    colorscale = list(c(0, 1), c("red", "pink")),
    showscale = FALSE,
    opacity = 0.7,
    name = "Fitted Plane"
  ) %>%
  plotly::layout(
    scene = list(
      xaxis = list(title = "X1"),
      yaxis = list(title = "X2"),
      zaxis = list(title = "Y")
    ),
    title = "Interactive 3D Scatterplot with Fitted Plane"
  )
```

The term `X1 * X2` is a shortcut for `X1 + X2 + X1:X2` where `X1:X2` is the interaction term.
R automatically includes the main effects of the predictors when an interaction 
term is included (variable inclusion principle).
The true but usually unknown $\beta$s are estimated quite precisely.

#### Formal test for interaction
We could apply a formal test for the interaction term by model comparison.
The command `anova(., .)` would compare the two models and test if the change in the
residual sum of squares is statistically interesting.

```{r}
m4.5 <- lm(Y ~ X1 + X2, data = d) # without interaction
anova(m4.5, m4.4)
```

One can show that the following test statistic is $F$ distributed under the null hypothesis (that $\beta_3=0$):

$$ F = \frac{\left(RSS_{\text{Model 1}} - RSS_{\text{Model 2}}\right) / \left(df_{\text{Model 1}} - df_{\text{Model 2}}\right)}{RSS_{\text{Model 2}} / df_{\text{Model 2}}}$$

where $RSS$ is the residual sum of squares, 
$df$ are the degrees of freedom of the residual sum of squares for both models.

The output of the `anova` command shows us the residual degress of freedom (`Res.Df`)
of both models, the residual sum of squares errors of both models (`RSS`), 
the sum of squared errors between model 1 and model 2 (`Sum of Sq`), the value of the 
F-statistic and the $p$-value for the hypothesis, that the coefficient for
the interaction term is zero ($\beta_3=0$). Model 1 RSS has 97 degrees of freedom, since we have 100 data points
and 3 parameters to estimate ($\beta_0, \beta_1, \beta_2$). Model 2 has 96 degrees of freedom, since
we have 100 data points and 4 parameters to estimate ($\beta_0, \beta_1, \beta_2, \beta_3$).

Let's verify the value of the $F$ statistic:

```{r}
RSS_model1 <- sum(residuals(m4.5)^2)
RSS_model2 <- sum(residuals(m4.4)^2)
df_model1 <- n - length(coef(m4.5))
df_model2 <- n - length(coef(m4.4))
F <- ((RSS_model1 - RSS_model2) / (df_model1 - df_model2)) / (RSS_model2 / df_model2)
F
# Sum of Sq
RSS_model1 - RSS_model2
```

In the numerator of the $F$ statistic, we have the change in the residual sum of squares 
(from the small (model 1) model to the larger one (model 2), `Sum of Sq`)
per additional parameter in the model (one additional parameter $\beta_3$). 

In the denominator, we have the residual sum of squares per residual degree of freedom of 
the larger model (model 2). Hence, in the numerator we have the information on how much
better we get with respect to the number of variables added, and in the denominator
we have information on how good the full model is with respect to its degrees of freedom.

The $p$-value is the probability of observing a value of the F statistic as extreme or more 
extreme than the one we observed, given that the null hypothesis is true. Here, 
the $p$-value is extremely small. So, statistically we would see an improvement in RSS
which is not explainable by chance alone.
But **let's be careful with $p$-values** and especially with fixed cutoff values for $p$, 
which we will **never** use in this script.
Even for a rather small effect $\beta_3$, we would reject the null hypothesis, if only the sample
size is large enough. Since a very small effect relative to $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ would
probably not be of practical interest, one should be careful with looking at $p$-values alone.
For instance, in Richard McElreath's book [Statistical Rethinking](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/),
there are no $p$-values at all. I like that.

If you again look at the comparison of the RSS between the two models, you would 
immediately see that the model with the interaction term is better (at least with respect to this metric). 
The difference is huge. We have already mentioned in the context of $R^2$ not to overinterpret 
such metric, because RSS is monotonically descreasing with number of variables added and reaches
zero when the number of variables equals the number of data points (see [exercise 3](#exercise3_multiple_regression)).

### Using an interaction plot to suspect a potential interaction {#interaction_plot}

Chronologically before we include an interaction term in the model, we can use an interaction plot
to see if there is a potential interaction between the predictors.
We can just create a categorical predictor out of the continuous predictors.
Just categorize the predictors into quartiles and plot the means of the dependent variable ($Y$).
If the lines are parallel, there is probably no interaction. If the lines are not parallel, 
there might be an interaction.

```{r}
n <- 100
X1 <- rnorm(n, 0, 5)
X2 <- rnorm(n, 0, 5)
Y <- 10 + 0.5 * X1 + 1 * X2 + 0.89 * X1 * X2 + rnorm(n, 0, 5)
d <- data.frame(X1 = X1, X2 = X2, Y = Y)

# Create categorical variables based on quartiles
d$X2_cat <- cut(d$X2, 
                breaks = quantile(d$X2, probs = c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1), na.rm = TRUE), 
                include.lowest = TRUE, 
                labels = c("Q1", "Q2", "Q3", "Q4"))

d$X1_cat <- cut(d$X1, 
                breaks = quantile(d$X1, probs = c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1), na.rm = TRUE), 
                include.lowest = TRUE, 
                labels = c("Q1", "Q2", "Q3", "Q4"))

# Create the interaction plot
interaction.plot(d$X2_cat, d$X1_cat, d$Y)
```

There seems to be an interaction of the predictors with respect to $Y$. The lines are not parallel.
If there was no interaction, the change in $Y$ with respect to $X_2$ would be the same 
for all levels of $X_1$.
This seems not to be the case here.
See [exercise 5](#exercise5_multiple_regression).

If we had one or both predictors already categorical, we would not have to discretize them before.

### Simpsons Paradox {#simpsons_paradox}

The [Simpsons paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox) is a phenomenon, 
in which a trend appears in several different groups of data but disappears 
or reverses when these groups are combined. I agree with the criticism that this is not really 
a paradox but a failure to consider confounding variables adequately. Let's quickly invent an example.
We are interested in the relationship *hours of muscle training* and *strength* (not based on evidence)
in children vs. adults. Within both groups there will be an increasing relationship. The more training,
the more muscle strength. But if we combine the groups, we will see a decreasing relationship.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
n <- 100
age <- c(rep("child", n/2), rep("adult", n/2))
training <- c(rnorm(n/2, 0, 5) + 30, rnorm(n/2, 0, 5)+ 10)
strength <- c(
  10 + 0.5 * training[1:(n/2)] + rnorm(n/2, 0, 2), # For children
  25 + 0.5 * training[(n/2 + 1):n] + rnorm(n/2, 0, 2) # For adults
)

d <- data.frame(age = age, training = training, strength = strength)

ggplot(d, aes(x = training, y = strength, color = age)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) + # Group-specific regression lines
  geom_smooth(data = d, aes(x = training, y = strength), 
              method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "black", linetype = "dashed", linewidth = 1.2) + # Overall regression line
  labs(title = "Regression Lines for Training and Strength",
       x = "Training",
       y = "Strength") +
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

- **Group-Specific Trends**:
   - In the group of **children** (blue line), strength **increases** with training, as indicated by the positive slope of the regression line.
   - Similarly, in the group of **adults** (red line), strength also **increases** with training.

- **Overall Trend**:
   - When both groups are combined and the categorical variable *age* is neglected, 
     the overall regression line (black, dashed) shows a **negative slope**, suggesting that **strength decreases** with training. 
   - This overall trend is opposite to the trends observed within the individual groups.

- **Why Does This Happen?**
   - This paradox occurs because the relationship between the grouping variable (`age`) and the independent variable (`training`) creates a confounding effect.
   - In this case: Children tend to have higher training values overall, 
     while adults tend to have lower training values. *Age* is associated with both *strength* and *training* and 
     is therefore a [*confounder*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding) in the relationship between *training* and *strength*. 
     Not adjusting (=including it in the regression model as predictor) for *age* leads to a misleading association.

## What happens when you just throw variables into multiple regression? {#throwing_variables}

This sub-chapter is **important**. I can guarantee you that not too many applied 
scientists using regression models know about this.

A first taste of causality.

Richard McElreath has 3 cool examples on 
[github](https://github.com/rmcelreath/causal_salad_2021/blob/main/1_causal_salad.r)
that show what happens in the context of *explanation* if you include variables the wrong 
way and explains this in a 
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNPYUVmY3NM&ab_channel=RichardMcElreath).

We will look at these below - **the pipe, the fork and the collider**. These are causal graphs showing the 
relationships between the variables. One is interested in the **effect** of X on Y.
In this case, it is truly an *effect*, since we create the models in such a way that changing
one variable ($X$), changes the other ($Y$) - which is indicated by an arrow in the graph.
These graphs are called DAGs - directed acyclic graphs. *Directed* because of the arrows,
*acyclic* because there are no cycles in the graph. One nice tool for drawing them is
[dagitty](https://www.dagitty.net/), which is also 
[implemented in R](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dagitty/index.html).
The [online drawing tool](https://www.dagitty.net/dags.html) is handy.

**Remember**: Not only can it hurt to add variables to the model in an explanatory (causal) context,
but also in a predictive context. The model can become unstable and the predictions
can become worse. This is called [overfitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting).

### Pipe
In this setting $X$ is associated with $Z$ and $Z$ is associated with $Y$. 
$X$ and $Y$ are not directly associated, but through $Z$ (see graph below).
If we condition on $Z$, the association between $X$ and $Y$ *disappears*.
This means, if we **know** the value of $Z$, $X$ does not give us any *additional* information about $Y$.

This can be seen in the scatterplot: Once we are within $Z=0$ (black dots) or $Z=1$ (red dots), 
$X$ does not give us any information about $Y$,
i.e., the point cloud is horizontal and there is no correlation.

The `inv_logit` function is the inverse of the logit function.
It assigns higher probability of $Z$ being $1$ if X has a higher value.
Let's plot this for understanding:

```{r}
x <- seq(-3, 3, 0.1)
plot(x, inv_logit(x), type = "l", col = "blue", lwd = 2, xlab = "X", ylab = "P(Z=1|X)")
```

Higher $X$ values lead to higher probabilities of $Z=1$. 
As you can see, more red dots are on the right side of the scatterplot below.

Now to the pipe and a mini simulation for it:

```{r}
# pipe
library(dagitty)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggdag)

dag <- dagitty( 'dag {
  X -> Z -> Y
}' )

dagitty::coordinates( dag ) <-
  list( x=c(X=0, Y=2, Z=1),
        y=c(X=0, Y=0, Z=0) )

ggdag(dag) + 
  theme_dag()

a <- 0.7
cols <- c( col.alpha(1,a) , col.alpha(2,a) )

# pipe
# X -> Z -> Y
N <- 1000
X <- rnorm(N)
Z <- rbern(N,inv_logit(X))
Y <- rnorm(N,(2*Z-1))

plot( X , Y , col=cols[Z+1] , pch=16 )
abline(lm(Y[Z==1]~X[Z==1]),col=2,lwd=3)
abline(lm(Y[Z==0]~X[Z==0]),col=1,lwd=3)
abline(lm(Y~X),lwd=3,lty=3)

cor(X[Z==1],Y[Z==1])
cor(X[Z==0],Y[Z==0])
```

Or in the framework of Simpsons paradox:

```{r}
library(rethinking)

N <- 1000
X <- rnorm(N)
Z <- rbern(N,inv_logit(X))
Y <- rnorm(N,(2*Z-1))
mod1 <- lm(Y ~ X) # without conditioning on Z
summary(mod1)
mod2 <- lm(Y ~ X + Z) # with conditioning on Z
summary(mod2)
```

Adding $Z$ to the model (i.e., conditioning on $Z$) makes the coefficient for $X$ disappear. 
Knowing $Z$ means that $X$ does not give us any additional information about $Y$.
See [exercise 7](#exercise7_multiple_regression).

$Z$ is also called a [**mediator**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediation_(statistics)).

We could easily verify that $Z$ constitutes a mediator by using Baron and 
Kenny's 1986 approach (see Wiki):

```{r}
summary(lm(Y ~ X))# Step 1
summary(lm(Z ~ X))# Step 2
summary(lm(Y ~ X + Z))# Step 3
```

Both coefficients for $X$ are "significant" in steps 1 and 2.
The coefficients for $Z$ in step 3 is "significant" and the coefficient for
$X$ is smaller compared to step 1. And not to forget: the very small $p$-values are strongly
related to the very large smaple size and a strict cutoff ($\alpha = 0.05$) makes no sense.

**Example**: *Hours of studying* is associated with *exam performance*.
This observation makes sense. A mediator in this context: *understanding/knowledge*.
One could study for hours inefficiently with low levels of concentration
and achieve low exam performance or one could study for a comparatively
low number of hours and achieve good results. If we know that a person has gained the
*understanding/knowledge*, the *hours of studying* do not give us any additional 
information with respect to *exam performance*.

So, in order to see the effect of $X$ on $Y$, we do *not* condition on $Z$.

### Fork {#fork}

In health science, this is the classical [confounder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding).
$Z$ is associated with $X$ and $Y$. $X$ and $Y$ are *actually* not associated (no arrow) but an association is 
still shown: `cor(X,Y) = 0.5097437`. 
But if we condition on $Z$, the association between $X$ and $Y$ disappears. The assocation is 
spurious in this case and *adjusting* for the confounder yields the correct result. 

```{r}
# fork
# X <- Z -> Y

dag <- dagitty( 'dag {
  X <- Z -> Y
}' )

dagitty::coordinates( dag ) <-
  list( x=c(X=0, Y=2, Z=1),
        y=c(X=0.5, Y=0.5, Z=0) )

ggdag(dag) + theme_dag()

N <- 1000
Z <- rbern(N)
X <- rnorm(N,2*Z-1)
Y <- rnorm(N,(2*Z-1))

plot( X , Y , col=cols[Z+1] , pch=16 )
abline(lm(Y[Z==1]~X[Z==1]),col=2,lwd=3)
abline(lm(Y[Z==0]~X[Z==0]),col=1,lwd=3)
abline(lm(Y~X),lwd=3,lty=3)

cor(X[Z==1],Y[Z==1])
cor(X[Z==0],Y[Z==0])
cor(X,Y)
```

In the example, we know that $Z$ is associated with both $X$ and $Y$ (per construction).
As you can see in the definitions of $X$, $Y$ and $Z$, $X$ and $Y$ would not be associated 
weren't it for $Z$. 

**Example**: *Carrying lighters* is (spuriously) associated with *lung cancer*. Obviously, *carrying a lighter*
does *not* cause lung cancer. *Carrying a lighter* is associated with *smoking*, since smokers need to light their
cigarrettes and how often do non-smokers carry a lighter just for fun? 
*Smoking* is (causally) associated with *lung cancer*. If you just look at the association between
*carrying a ligher* and *lung cancer*, you would find an association. But if you condition on *smoking*, the association
disappears. See [exercise 13](#exercise13_multiple_regression).

### Collider {#collider}
This is rather interesting. $X$ and $Y$ are independently associated 
with $Z$. This can be seen in the toy example below, where $X$ and $Y$ are used
for the definition of $Z$. $Z$ is defined as a **sum 
score** of $X$ and $Y$. Sum scores are *very* often used in health sciences (and others).
The higher the sum score, the higher the probability that $Z=1$.
Now, *if* we know the value of $Z$, $X$ and $Y$ are negatively associated (see graph). 
The reason for this association is that there is a compensatory effect. In order to get a high 
score, you can either have a high value of $X$ or $Y$ or both.
This induces the negative correlation.

```{r}
# collider
# X -> Z <- Y

#dag
dag <- dagitty( 'dag {
  X -> Z <- Y
}' )

dagitty::coordinates( dag ) <-
  list( x=c(X=0, Y=2, Z=1),
        y=c(X=0, Y=0, Z=1) )

ggdag(dag) + theme_dag()

N <- 1000
X <- rnorm(N)
Y <- rnorm(N)
Z <- rbern(N,inv_logit(2*X+2*Y-2))

plot( X , Y , col=cols[Z+1] , pch=16 )
abline(lm(Y[Z==1]~X[Z==1]),col=2,lwd=3)
abline(lm(Y[Z==0]~X[Z==0]),col=1,lwd=3)
abline(lm(Y~X),lwd=3,lty=3)

cor(Y[Z==1], X[Z==1])
cor(Y[Z==0], X[Z==0])

summary(lm(Y ~ X)) # mod1
summary(lm(Y ~ X + Z)) # mod2
```

If you think of Simpsons paradox again, conditioning on $Z$ *creates* an association between $X$ and $Y$,
which would otherwise be independent (by definition). So by learning the value of $Z$, we can learn something
from $X$ about $Y$. On the one hand, adding $Z$ to the model creates an association where there is none,
on the other hand, *prediction* of $Y$ is better with $Z$ in the model! In prediction, we largely
do not care about the causal structure. We just want to predict $Y$ as accurately as possible.

The sum score example is also called [Berkson's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkson%27s_paradox).
Let's check if this also works for three variables in a sum score 
in [exercise 10](#exercise10_multiple_regression).

### Multicollinearity {#multicollinearity}
Westfall section 8.4 and McElreath section 6.1 cover this topic.
[Multicollinearity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicollinearity) means that there is a strong
correlation between two or more predictors. It is *perfect* multicollinearity when the correlation is 1.
For example, if you accidentally include the same variable twice in the model, or when you include
the elements of a sum score and the sum score itself as predictors in the model. R just gives you 
an *NA* if you do this in `lm`. 

#### Example from McElreath 6.1 {#mcElreath_6.1}
The code creates body heights and leg lengths (left and right) for 100 people.

`runif` draws a uniform random number between 40 and 50% of height as leg length, hence on average 45%.
The slope in the linear regression should therefore be around the average height divided by the average leg length:
$\frac{10}{0.45 \cdot 10} \sim 2.2$.

```{r}
library(rethinking)

N <- 100
set.seed(909)
height <- rnorm(N, 10, 2)
leg_prop <- runif(N, 0.4, 0.5)
leg_left <- leg_prop * height + rnorm(N, 0, 0.02)
leg_right <- leg_prop * height + rnorm(N, 0, 0.02)

d <- data.frame(height = height, leg_left = leg_left, leg_right = leg_right)
cor(d$leg_left, d$leg_right)

m4.6 <- quap(
  alist(
    height ~ dnorm(mu, sigma),
    mu <- a + bl * leg_left + br * leg_right,
    a ~ dnorm(10, 100),
    bl ~ dnorm(2, 10),
    br ~ dnorm(2, 10),
    sigma ~ dexp(1)
  ),    data = d
)
precis(m4.6)
plot(precis(m4.6))
```

With the given regression model, one asks the question: "What is the value of knowing each leg's length, after 
already knowing the other leg's length, with respect to height?" The answer is: "Not much.", since they are highly correlated.
Both coefficients are not around the expected $\beta$ and the credible intervals are wide and include the 
credible value $0$.

```{r}
post <- extract.samples(m4.6)
plot( bl ~ br, post, col=col.alpha(rangi2,0.1), pch = 16 )
```

Since the two coefficients are almost perfectly multicollinear 
(`cor(d$leg_left, d$leg_right)=0.9997458`), already knowing the left leg's 
length, knowing the right leg's length does not give us any additional information about height.
Leaving out the right leg length would give the correct result ([exercise 11](#exercise11_multiple_regression)).


#### Example from Westfall 8.4

In the example below, the second prector $X_2$ is a perfect linear function of the first predictor $X_1$.

```{r}
# Westfall 8.4.
set.seed(12345)
X1 = rnorm(100)
X2 = 2*X1 -1     # Perfect collinearity
Y = 1 + 2*X1 + 3*X2 + rnorm(100,0,1)
summary(lm(Y~X1+X2))
```

Let's look at a 3D plot:

```{r}
library(plotly)

# Generate data
set.seed(42)
X1 <- rnorm(100)
X2 <- 2 * X1 - 1  # Perfect collinearity
Y  <- 1 + 2 * X1 + 3 * X2 + rnorm(100, 0, 1)

# Create the 3D scatter plot with vertical lines
plot_ly() %>%
  add_markers(x = X1, y = X2, z = Y, 
              marker = list(color = Y, colorscale = "Viridis", size = 5),
              name = "Data Points") %>%
  layout(title = "3D Scatter Plot",
         scene = list(xaxis = list(title = "X1"),
                      yaxis = list(title = "X2"),
                      zaxis = list(title = "Y")))
#VIF(lm(Y ~ X1 + X2)) # error
#check_model(lm(Y ~ X1 + X2)) # error
```


There is no unique solution for a plane in this case.
Infinitely many planes can be defined using the "line" in space.
The problem collapses into the simple linear regression problem.
One can just plug in the formula for $X2$ into the model, which yields the identical result:

```{r}
set.seed(12345)
X1 = rnorm(100)
# Y = 1 + 2*X1 + 3*(2*X1 -1) + rnorm(100,0,1) = 
Y = -2 + 8*X1 + rnorm(100,0,1)
summary(lm(Y ~ X1))
```

In reality, you only have one parameter ($X1$ or $X2$) in the case of perfect multicollinearity.


## More than 2 predictors

In practice, you often want more than two predictors in the model.
If you listen closely to the research question raised by yourself or 
your colleagues, often it won't be clearly stated what goal you want to achieve
with the regression model: 
[prediction or explanation](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/statistical-science/volume-25/issue-3/To-Explain-or-to-Predict/10.1214/10-STS330.full).

If we want to be rigorous about the true relationships between variables, 
we need to think about the causal structure of the variables, 
as [Richard McElreath](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvhuYONl1o0&ab_channel=KI-Campus)
argues. 

In order not to just throw in variables into our regression model and hope for the best,
in order to have a fighting chance, we use the information provided
in Chapter 5 in the Statistical Rethinking book.

**Overall strategy for modeling:**

- **Have a research question** and decide how this question can be answered: 
  Quantitatively (experiment or observational study) or 
  qualitatively. 
  Remember: Statistical modeling is not a catch-all approach to
  turn data into truth. 
  And: We never want to play *find-the-right-statistical-test-Bingo*.
  Statistical tests should make sense and not just thrown at data.
  What does the current literature say about the topic?

- **Define goal**: Prediction or explanation? 
  *Prediction*: Use everything and every model type you can get your hands 
  on to "best" predict the outcome (neural nets, random forests, etc.).
  *Explanation*: How do the variables relate to each other, 
  how do they influence each other? Temporal relationships are important. 
  And we want interpretable models.

- **Do** exploratory data analysis (**EDA**) to get a feeling for the data:
  - This includes (among others) scatterplots, histograms, boxplots,
    correlation matrices, etc.
  - How are the raw correlations/associations between the variables?
  - How are the variables distributed?
  - Are there outliers?
  - Are there missing values and why are the values missing?
  - Think about the data generating process. How did the data come about?
  - There is no shame in fitting exploratory models too.

- **Draw a DAG** (directed acyclic graph) of the hypthesized relationships between 
  the variables, even though we will not do formal 
  [causal inference](https://miguelhernan.org/whatifbook) in this lecture yet
  (hopefully in the next).
  The drawn DAG has testable implications (more below). See 5.1.2 in Rethinking.
  Nicely enough, `dagitty`spits out:
  - The [adjustment sets](https://rdrr.io/cran/dagitty/man/adjustmentSets.html) 
    for the regression model based on a DAG. Which variables should I include
    as covariates in my model, *if* the DAG is correct?
  - The [implied conditional dependencies](https://search.r-project.org/CRAN/refmans/dagitty/html/impliedConditionalIndependencies.html) 
    coming from the DAG. These
    can be checked with the data. It is not a proof that we have the true
    relationships depicted by the DAG, but it is a good start.

- **Decide on a statistical model** (more on that later).

- **Define priors** for the parameters of the model:
  If we do not know much, we choose vague priors (i.e., wide range of plausible 
  parameter values). In the best case,
  priors should be well argued for, especially in a *low-data* setting
  (if we do not have many observations).

- **Prior predictive checks**: Does the model produce outcomes ($Y$) that
  are at all plausible? If not, we might have to rethink the model and/or priors.

- **Fit and check the model**:
  If the models makes certain assumptions, check if these are met.
  For the classical regression model, see Chapter 4 in Westfall.
  Posterior predictive check: Check if the model produces new data that looks 
  like the observed data.

- **Interpret and report** the results.

### Example in NHANES data {#example_nhanes}

We will now try to invent a not too exotic example with 
[NHANES](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.html) data.
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a large, 
ongoing study conducted by the CDC to assess the health and nutritional status 
of the U.S. population. It combines interviews, physical examinations, and 
laboratory tests to collect data on demographics, diet, chronic diseases, and 
physical activity. NHANES uses a complex, nationally representative sampling 
design, making it a valuable resource for public health research and policy 
development. 

Open data is **great** and NHANES provides all the data to download for free
without any restrictions or even a registration. For convenience, Randall Pruim
created an [R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/NHANES/NHANES.pdf) 
called `NHANES` that contains a cleaned-up version of the
NHANES data from 2009-2012. We will use this and ignore the complex sampling
design for now. 

```{r}
#install.packages("NHANES")
library(pacman)
p_load(NHANES, tidyverse)
data(NHANES)
head(NHANES)
unique(NHANES$SurveyYr)
colnames(NHANES)
```

The variable descriptions can be found 
[here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/NHANES/NHANES.pdf).
As an exercise, please do exploratory data analysis; 
see [exercise 14](#exercise14_multiple_regression).

#### Research question 
Does *Physical activity* (PhysActive) **influence** the *average systolic 
blood pressure* (BPSysAve) in adults ($\ge 20$ years)?

We propose the following relationships among the variables 
(and limit ourselves to 4 covariates):

```{r}
df <- NHANES # shorter

# Define the DAG
dag <- dagitty('dag {
  PhysActive -> BPSysAve
  Age -> PhysActive
  Age -> BPSysAve
  PhysActive -> BMI
  BMI -> BPSysAve
  Gender -> PhysActive
  Gender -> BMI
  Gender -> BPSysAve
}')

# Set node coordinates for a nice layout
dagitty::coordinates(dag) <- list(
  x = c(PhysActive = 0, BPSysAve = 2, Age = 1, BMI = 1, Gender = 0.5),
  y = c(PhysActive = 1, BPSysAve = 1, Age = 2, BMI = 1.5, Gender = 2)
)

# Plot the DAG with larger node labels and bubbles
ggdag(dag) + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  geom_dag_point(size = 20, color = "black") +  # Increase node size
  geom_dag_text(size = 2.5, color = "white") +    # Increase label size
  ggtitle("Hypothesized Relationships") + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

This DAG illustrates the hypothesized relationships between physical activity, 
age, BMI, gender, and blood pressure (BPSysAve). Physical activity potentially directly 
influences blood pressure, as regular exercise is hypothesized to improve 
cardiovascular health and lower blood pressure. Age has a direct effect on 
blood pressure, as arterial stiffness and other age-related physiological changes 
contribute to higher blood pressure over time. BMI also plays a role, with higher 
BMI being associated with increased blood pressure due to greater vascular 
resistance and metabolic factors. Additionally, gender affects blood pressure, 
as men and women often have different baseline levels due to hormonal and 
physiological differences.

There are also indirect pathways that contribute to these relationships. 
Age influences both physical activity and BMI, as older individuals tend to 
be less active and may experience weight gain due to metabolic changes (confounder). 
BMI and physical activity are also interconnected, physical activity influences BMI, 
further influencing blood 
pressure (mediation). Gender plays a role in both BMI and physical activity, 
as men and women tend to have different average BMI distributions 
and physical activity levels due to both biological and societal factors (confounder).

Note, that we have a very large sample size (6,919 people). As exercise for later,
we randomly select 50 to 100 participants and repeat the analysis.
This would also give us the opportunity to study how well we can
infer the relationships in the larger sample from the smaller one,
which could be an eye-opener.

**Which variables should be included in the model?**

```{r}
adjustmentSets(dag, exposure = "PhysActive", outcome = "BPSysAve")
impliedConditionalIndependencies(dag)
```

The one adjustment set (using the command `adjustmentSets`) proposed by `dagitty` tells us that 
we should include age and gender as covariates in the model (in addition to *PhysActive*), 
*if* the DAG is correct.
Note that **we do not include all three covariables in the model here**, just two of them.

*If* the DAG is correct, this would imply some conditional independencies
(using the command `impliedConditionalIndependencies`) .
We should probably check them to see how this is done:

First, we need to test, if age and BMI are independent, 
*if* we condition on gender and physical activity;
i.e., just add them to the regression model.
This is the case:

```{r}
# Age _||_ BMI | Gnder, PhyA
summary(lm(Age ~ BMI + Gender + PhysActive, data = df %>% dplyr::filter(Age >= 20)))
```

The implication can be confirmed. 

**Interpretation**: If we know gender and physical activity (yes/no) of a person,
BMI does not offer any *additional* information about age.

Second, I would go out on a limb and say that there is no relationship 
between age and gender, at least not in a statistically relevant sense.


#### Goal

The **goal** is to better understand (explain) the relationship between 
physical activity and blood pressure while considering age, BMI and gender. 
I would suggest that in most cases relevant for us, one wants to understand
relationships rather to predict an outcome.

#### EDA
[Exercise 14](#exercise14_multiple_regression)

#### Statistical model 

The outcome is a continuous variable (blood pressure), the exposure is a binary 
variable (physical activity yes/no). 
Surprise, surprise, we could try a **multiple linear regression model** here.

As a first approximation, let's assume *BPSysAve* is (sufficiently) normally distributed,
which can be critized. Let's quickly visualize the distribution of *BPSysAve* and overlay
a normal density with paramaters estimated from the data ($\mu$ sample mean of *BPSysAve*, 
$\sigma$ sample standard deviation of *BPSysAve*):

```{r, warning=FALSE}
df_age <- df %>% dplyr::filter(Age >= 20)
df_age %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = BPSysAve)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(density)), 
  bins = 30, fill = "lightblue", alpha = 0.6) +  
  geom_density(color = "blue", linewidth = 1) +  
  stat_function(
    fun = dnorm, 
    args = list(mean = mean(df_age$BPSysAve, na.rm = TRUE), 
    sd = sd(df_age$BPSysAve, na.rm = TRUE)), 
    color = "red", linewidth = 1, linetype = "dashed"
  ) +  # Theoretical normal curve
  labs(
    x = "Systolic Blood Pressure (BPSysAve)", 
    y = "Density", 
    title = "Distribution of Systolic Blood Pressure with Normal Curve"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

Not quite normal, but we will assume it for now.

#### Priors

Now, let's write down the statistical model.
We choose vague priors since we have a vast data set.
The advantage of the Bayesian approach remains (that we have a fully 
probabilistic model). Admitted, using Bayes is much more technical, at least
at first glance.

We center age again, which makes the interpretation of the intercept easier.

- The intercept ($\beta_0$) is the expected value of *BPSysAve* for a person 
  of average age, not physically active (reference level of the factor) and 
  female gender (reference level of the factor).

- The coefficient for *PhysActive* ($\beta_1$) is the expected difference in 
  *BPSysAve* between a physically active person and a non-physically active person, 
  holding all other predictors constant. *BPSysAve* ranges from 78 to 226 mmHg.
  If we do not know enough, we can just take a very vague prior for now:
  $\beta_1 \sim \text{Normal}(0, 50)$. With 95% probability, the effect of
  physical activity on *BPSysAve* is between -100 and 100.

- $\beta_2$: The expected change in *BPSysAve* for a one-year increase in age 
  (above the mean age), holding all other predictors constant. 
  $\beta_2 \sim \text{Normal}(0, 10)$. This effect should be comparatively small,
  since we are dealing with a one-year increase in age. We could further 
  standardize age, then the effect would be in relation to one standard 
  deviations increase in age.

- $\sigma$: The standard deviation of the residuals. 
  $\sigma \sim \text{Uniform}(0, 50)$. We use a vague prior.
  95% of the residuals are between -100 and 100. This seems plausible enough.
  We use a constant standard deviation along the expectation. 
  This could be false (systolic blood pressure could scatter much more around 
  the mean for higher age for instance), but one can start with that. 

\begin{eqnarray*}
BPSysAve_i &\sim& \text{Normal}(\mu_i, \sigma)\\
\mu_i &=& \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot PhysActive + \beta_2 \cdot Age_{centered} + \beta_3 \cdot Gender\\
\beta_0 &\sim& \text{Normal}(140, 20)\\
\beta_1 &\sim& \text{Normal}(0, 50)\\
\beta_2 &\sim& \text{Normal}(0, 10)\\
\beta_3 &\sim& \text{Normal}(0, 10)\\
\sigma &\sim& \text{Uniform}(0, 50)
\end{eqnarray*}

Note that age and gender are not influenced by each other.

#### Prior Predictive Checks {#prior_predictive_checks_NHANES}
Now we simply draw from the priors and thereby generate systolic blood pressure values.
Note that we implicitely assumed below that $PhysActive=1$ (person is physically active);
$Age_{centered}=1 (1 years above average) and $Gender = 1$ (could mean female). 

```{r}
# Prior predictive checks
set.seed(123)
n_sims <- dim(df_age)[1] # 7235 participants
beta_0_vec <- rnorm(n_sims, 140, 20)
beta_1_vec <- rnorm(n_sims, 0, 50)
beta_2_vec <- rnorm(n_sims, 0, 10)
beta_3_vec <- rnorm(n_sims, 0, 10)
sigma_vec <- runif(n_sims, 0, 50)
BPSysAve_sim <- rnorm(n_sims, beta_0_vec + beta_1_vec + beta_2_vec + beta_3_vec, sigma_vec)
```

This yields also negative values (please verify) for *BPSysAve*, which is biologically not plausible.

In [exercise 15](#exercise15_multiple_regression) we will play around with the priors 
until the prior predictive check producues plausible values. 

**Admitted**, one should probably not look at the distribution of data while doing this.
On the other hand, we could have just Googled the distribution of blood pressure values.
This is the result:

```{r}
# Prior predictive checks
set.seed(123)
n_sims <- dim(df_age)[1] # 7235 participants
beta_0_vec <- rnorm(n_sims, 120, 2)
beta_1_vec <- rnorm(n_sims, 0, 5)
beta_2_vec <- rnorm(n_sims, 0.5, 1)
beta_3_vec <- rnorm(n_sims, 0, 5)
sigma_vec <- runif(n_sims, 0, 20)
age_vec <- sample(df_age$Age-mean(df_age$Age), n_sims, replace = TRUE)
phys_act <- as.numeric(sample(df_age$PhysActive, n_sims, replace = TRUE))-1
gender_vec <- as.numeric(sample(df_age$Gender, n_sims, replace = TRUE))-1
BPSysAve_sim <- rnorm(n_sims, beta_0_vec + 
                        beta_1_vec*phys_act + 
                        beta_2_vec*age_vec + 
                        beta_3_vec*gender_vec, sigma_vec)
hist(BPSysAve_sim, breaks = 50, main = "Prior predictive checks for BPSysAve")

df_sim_vs_obs <- data.frame(
  BPSysAve_sim = BPSysAve_sim,
  BPSysAve_obs = df_age$BPSysAve
)

# Combine observed and simulated values into one long-format data frame
df_long <- df_sim_vs_obs %>%
  tidyr::pivot_longer(cols = everything(), 
                      names_to = "Type", values_to = "BPSysAve") %>%
  mutate(Type = factor(Type, levels = c("BPSysAve_obs", "BPSysAve_sim"), 
                       labels = c("Observed", "Simulated")))

# Plot densities of both observed and simulated values
ggplot(df_long, aes(x = BPSysAve, fill = Type)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +  # Semi-transparent density curves
  labs(
    x = "Systolic Blood Pressure", 
    y = "Density", 
    title = "Observed vs. Simulated Systolic Blood Pressure"
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Observed" = "blue", "Simulated" = "red")) + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

```

Looks decent. Not quite there yet. 
The blood pressure values have smaller variances and are skewed.
Let's nevertheless fit the model.

#### Fit and check model
 We use `quap` for the model fitting.

```{r}
library(data.table)
df <- NHANES
df <- as.data.table(df)

# Compute age mean for centering
Age_mean <- mean(df[Age >= 20,]$Age, na.rm = TRUE) # adults

# Filter age
df <- df %>% dplyr::filter(Age >= 20) %>% 
  dplyr::select(BPSysAve, PhysActive, Age, Gender, BMI) %>%
  drop_na()
dim(df) # 6919    7
sum(is.na(df)) # 0

# Fit model
m_NHANES <- quap(
  alist(
    BPSysAve ~ dnorm(mu, sigma), 
    mu <- beta_0 + beta_1[PhysActive] + beta_2 * (Age - Age_mean) + beta_3[Gender],
    beta_0 ~ dnorm(120, 7),
    beta_1[PhysActive] ~ dnorm(0, 10),  
    beta_2 ~ dnorm(5, 10),
    beta_3[Gender] ~ dnorm(0, 10),  
    sigma ~ dunif(0, 20) 
  ),
  data = df
)

precis(m_NHANES, depth = 2)

# We want to know the expected difference for the levels of PhysActive and Gender:
# (which is not directly visible in the summary)
post <- extract.samples(m_NHANES)
post$diff_PhysActive <- post$beta_1[,2] - post$beta_1[,1]
post$diff_G <- post$beta_3[,2] - post$beta_3[,1]

library(conflicted)
conflicts_prefer(posterior::sd)

#as.data.frame(precis(post, depth = 2, digits = 3))
post_summary <- as.data.frame(precis(post, depth = 2, digits = 3))  # Convert to dataframe
post_summary[, -which(names(post_summary) == "histogram")]  # Remove histogram column
```

The summary tells us that `diff_PhysActive` is $-0.74$ with a large proportion
of the posterior $<0$. Please research if this is a clinically relevant difference.
My guess is: no.

#### Fit model using `lm` (Frequentist approach)

We can also fit the model using the Frequentist approach.
No priors. The results should be very similar due to the large sample size.

```{r}
library(car)
dim(df) 
df <- df %>% mutate(Age_center = Age - mean(Age))
mod <- lm(BPSysAve ~ PhysActive + Age_center + Gender, data = df)
summary(mod)
check_model(mod)
qqPlot(mod) # bad
```

The results are similar to the Bayesian approach.
In the summary output we see that the effect of physical activity is $-0.73693$
with a small $p$-value ($0.051$). This is one example for the absurdity of strict cutoffs
for $p$-values. The other coefficients including the estimate for $\sigma$ are also similar.
It's always a good idea to double-check. 

Model fit could be better, the model thinks the blood pressure is normally distributed.
There also seems to be some heteroscadasticity and the residuals are not normally distributed.

**By the way, usually**, one would fit this model by throwing in all variables into the model, including BMI.
Let's see if this approach changes the results:

```{r}
mod <- lm(BPSysAve ~ PhysActive + Age + Gender  + BMI, data = df) # add BMI
summary(mod)
check_model(mod)
qqPlot(mod) 
```

**This changed the results notably**. Before, the effect of physical activity was $-0.73693$
with a rather small $p$-value,
now it is $-0.22870$ with a $p$-value ten times as large.

**Remember this**: The interpretation of a whole paper could change by falsely including
an additional variable (in this case BMI).

#### Improve model {#improve_model_NHANES}
Now, that we have seen that the model fit is probably not sufficient, we could try to improve it.

**First** order of business is the **non-normality** of the blood pressure values (outcome).
The model predicts normally distributed values, which is not the case.
It seems that the blood pressure values are right-skewed.

Let's try a log-normal distribution for the outcome variable, which only 
takes positive values and is skewed. 

We would **further** try to model $\sigma$ as a linear function of $\mu$.
For higher expected values of *BPSysAve*, we would expect higher variability.
Hence, we try to **explicitely model heteroscadasticity**.

Note, that we have no problem with adding parameters to the model 
because of the large sample size.

See [exercise 16](#exercise16_multiple_regression).

\begin{eqnarray*}
BPSysAve_i &\sim& \text{Log-Normal}(\mu_i, \sigma_i)\\
\sigma_i &=& \text{exp}(\beta_4 + \beta_5 \cdot \mu_i)\\
\mu_i &=& \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot PhysActive + \beta_2 \cdot Age_{centered} + \beta_3 \cdot Gender\\
\beta_0 &\sim& \text{Normal}(140, 20)\\
\beta_1 &\sim& \text{Normal}(0, 50)\\
\beta_2 &\sim& \text{Normal}(0, 10)\\
\beta_3 &\sim& \text{Normal}(0, 10)\\
\beta_4 &\sim& \text{Normal}(0, 10)\\
\beta_5 &\sim& \text{Uniform}(0, 50)
\end{eqnarray*}

We now allow the standard deviation $\sigma_i$ to be different for different values of the mean.
With `exp()` we ensure that $\sigma_i$ is positive.
This time, we assume: $log(BPSysAve_i) \sim \text{Normal}(\mu_i, \sigma_i)$. That's what it means
to be log-normally distributed.  

**Fit improved model**

)

#precis(m_NHANES_lnorm, depth = 2)
nhanes_summary <- as.data.frame(precis(m_NHANES_lnorm, depth = 2))  # Convert to dataframe

# difference in levels of PhysActive and Gender (catorical variables):
post_lnorm <- extract.samples(m_NHANES_lnorm)
post_lnorm$diff_PhysActive <- post_lnorm$beta_1[,2] - post_lnorm$beta_1[,1]
post_lnorm$diff_G <- post_lnorm$beta_3[,2] - post_lnorm$beta_3[,1]
#precis(post_lnorm, depth = 2)
post_lnorm_summary <- as.data.frame(precis(post_lnorm, depth = 2))  # Convert to dataframe
post_lnorm_summary[, -which(names(post_lnorm_summary) == "histogram")]  # Remove histogram column
```

`diff_PhysActive` is now  $-0.003350291$ with a very tight credible interval
containing $0$ as a credible effect. The model is pretty sure, that the effect
is practically zero.

Let's visualize the posterior predictive distributions of 100 samples:

```{r}
# posterior predictive checks
sample_BP <- sim(m_NHANES_lnorm, n = 1000)

# Convert the first 100 rows of the posterior samples into a long format for ggplot
df_posterior <- as.data.frame(t(sample_BP[1:100,])) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = "Simulation", values_to = "BPSysAve_sim")

# Create the plot
ggplot() +
  geom_density(data = df_posterior, aes(x = BPSysAve_sim, group = Simulation), 
               color = "lightblue", alpha = 0.05) +
  geom_density(data = df, aes(x = BPSysAve), color = "green", linewidth = 1.2) +
  labs(title = "Density Estimation: Original vs. Posterior Samples",
       x = "Systolic Blood Pressure",
       y = "Density") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

With respect to the distribution of blood pressure, the model looks much better now.
Note, that we did not assume that the residuals are normally distributed, neither
did we assume homoscedasticity (on the contrary).

See [exercise 17](#exercise17_multiple_regression).

#### Interpret and report results

Summarizing the results, we find the expected direction of association in our first model.
The effect of physical activity on blood pressure was negative. 
After improving the model fit, we concluded that the small but clinically irrelevant effect
from the first model dissapeared.
It would be interesting to see how other variables containing more information 
influence blood pressure, like *PhysActiveDays* (Number of days in a typical week 
that participant does moderate or vigorous intensity activity).

### Concluding remarks

The NHANES example was a somewhat realistic instance of a multiple regression model
which could easily be encountered in practice. In a Master thesis, we are often in 
a low-data setting with 20-150 observations. Here, the priors are much more important.

[Exercise 18](#exercise18_multiple_regression) asks you to repeat the analysis 
with a smaller sample size.

We saw that we can readily adapt the model, if assumptions of the classical 
linear regression model are violated. In our case, we had to model the outcome
as log-normal in order to allow for the model to predict skewed blood pressure values. 
In addition, we explicitly modeled heteroscedasticity by allowing the standard deviation
to grow with the mean. Theoretically, one could build arbitrarily complex models
this way. Of course, syntax problems and convergence issues could arise.
Even in this example some starting values were not fit for purpose, which is why
I had to add the `set.seed()` command in the improved model.

## eLearning 2

### Part 1

- Repeat the entire content we have covered in this lecture so far. 
  Try to grasp the big-picture view of what we want to achieve.
  We have started out with the simplest statistical model possible (mean model),
  then added one predictor (simple linear regression), and we are now in the process
  of adding more predictors (multiple regression).
- Read chapters in the books from Westfall and McElreath to deepen your understanding.
- Try to understand chapter 4 (above) as well. We will go through all the details
  on our last lecture day of course.
- Read [this paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1836955314000083) 
  from the Journal of Physiotherapy.
  - Did they apply $p$-value correction for multiple testing?
  - Did they work with a strict $p$-value cutoff?
  - In the methods section they state "Variables with non-normally distributed residuals were logarithmically
    transformed prior to performing linear regression analyses,...". Is it irrelevant if the residuals/variables
    are left- or right-skewed? Simulate data from a strongly left- and right-skewed distribution,
    draw the histogram and also draw the histogram of the log-transformed data. What do you see?
  - They use linear regression analysis (see "Data analysis"). Write down the model they use in Frequentist terms 
  (since they worked with that).
  - Would you expect the main statement of the paper to change if they had used a larger sample size?

### Part 2

- Read [this paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0037196308000620) 
  about misconceptions about $p$-values.

- Consider [the article about respiratory strength in ALS](https://www.neurology.org/doi/pdfdirect/10.1212/WNL.0000000000206830?casa_token=3gmqaV-EM0sAAAAA:u8Aju7H7UUNxxFpDD_8WKXAo3uGxc3ZYVI-mFh1ILiEpN2YEVAn14V8xJVbIlX8-mResXuNZFOfAIdE) 
  which was sent during eLearning 1:
  - Which (if any) mistakes according to the paper about misconceptions about $p$-values 
    did the authors make?
  - Which statements about finding a "(non-)significant" effect would (probably) change if we doubled 
    the sample size?
  - Is the data of the trial available?
  - Is the code for the analysis available?
  - Write down the linear regression model(s) mentioned in the text: "Linear
    regression models were used to assess group diﬀerences in
    pre-to-post change for the primary outcomes of interest
    (MEP, MIP). These models included post-test scores as the
    outcome with group status and pre-test scores as predictors." 

- Read and study sections 9.2 to 9.3 (pages 205 to 213) in Westfalls book.

## Sample exam questions for this chapter (in German since exam is in German)

### Question 1

Welche(s) Regressionsmodell(e) ist/sind *linear*?

- $Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i^4 + \beta_2 X_i^6$

- $Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \log(X_i)$

- $Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1^{X_i}$

- $Y_i = \beta_0 + \sin(\beta_1 X_i) \cdot cos(\beta_2)$

### Question 2 

Welche Aussage(n) ist/sind hinsichtlich des Interaktionseffekts (Formel unten)
korrekt?

$$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{1i} + \beta_2 X_{2i} + \beta_3 X_{1i} \cdot X_{2i}$$

- Interaktionsterme können nur zwischen kategorialen Variablen verwendet werden. 
- Der Effekt von $X_1$ auf $Y$ hängt davon ab, welchen Wert $X_2$ hat. 
- Das Modell ist nicht mehr linear, weil der Interaktionsterm $X_1 \cdot X_2$ enthalten ist. 
- Der Effekt von $X_2$ auf $Y$ hängt davon ab, welchen Wert $X_1$ hat.

### Question 3

Es sei der folgende R-Code gegeben:

```{r}
set.seed(42)
N <- 1000

sim_cor <- numeric(1000)
for (i in 1:1000) {
  # Simulate data
  # X: Income (in 1000s), right-skewed
  X <- rgamma(N, shape = 2, rate = 0.1)
  
  # Z: Stress events per day ~ Poisson, depends on income
  lambda_Z <- exp(3 - 0.05 * X)
  Z <- rpois(N, lambda = lambda_Z)
  
  # Y: Sleep quality (1 = poor sleep), depends on stress level
  p_Y <- plogis(-2 + 0.5 * Z)
  Y <- rbinom(N, size = 1, prob = p_Y)
  
  # Calculate cond correlation between X and Y
  sim_cor[i] <- cor(X[Z == 3], Y[Z == 3])  # Correlation when Z = 3
}

mean(sim_cor)
```

Welche Aussage(n) ist/sind korrekt?

- Wenn man den Wert von Z kennt, trägt X nichts zur Erklärung von Y bei.
- Der Code simuliert einen sog. *Pipe*.
- Der zugehörige DAG ist $X \rightarrow Z \rightarrow Y$.
- $cor(X, Y) \ne 0$.
